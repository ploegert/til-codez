#Mac Controller Support

Attempting to play video games natively on OS X has always been a rough proposition due to lack of supported games and hardware; but for years Colin Munro allowed us to utilize a Windows Xbox360 controller through a [custom driver](http://tattiebogle.net/index.php/ProjectRoot/Xbox360Controller/OsxDriver). 

Sadly, Yosemite kernel extension signing requirements broke Colin's last build; though fortunately the project has been [forked to GitHub](https://github.com/d235j/360Controller), and has since reimplemented full controller support, rumble, LED, & System Preferences prefpane functionality. Game on!
