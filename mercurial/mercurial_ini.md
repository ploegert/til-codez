# mercurial.ini -- home of mercurial's config.

(or on non-windows machines, your '.hgrc' file.)

Your mercurial.ini file is located here:

    %userprofile%\mercurial.ini
    
(If you don't have a file at '%userprofile%\mercurial.ini' then create one now)

In powershell, you would edit:

    $env:userprofile\mercurial.ini


To edit the config of a single repo, look for the `.hg\hgrc` file
