#Is your product being flagged as a virus/malware

If anyone is reporting that your product is a virus, then virus total will know about it

One company was flagging NimbleText as a virus. I found out who via Virus Total.

I emailed them (the problem company, not virus total) and they corrected the issue within a day.



If your webpage is flagged as containing malware that's a different problem. See Google Search Console tip.
